**Library management Project**

This project aims to provide a simple Library management system, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data. The project utilizes Spring framework for backend development and RESTful APIs for communication, while JavaScript is used for frontend development.

**Features:**
- Create, read, update, and delete Books
- Retrieve user data via RESTful APIs
- Frontend interface for user interaction

**Technologies Used:**
- Spring Framework: Backend development
- RESTful APIs: Communication between frontend and backend
- JavaScript: Frontend development

**Project Structure:**
- `backend`: Contains the backend code developed using Spring framework.
  - `src/main/java`: Java source code for backend logic and RESTful APIs.
  - `src/main/resources`: Configuration files for Spring application.
- `frontend`: Contains the frontend code developed using JavaScript.
  - `index.html`: Main HTML file for user interface.
  - `styles.css`: CSS styles for styling the frontend.
  - `script.js`: JavaScript code for frontend logic and interaction with backend APIs.

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd users-management`
3. Backend Setup:
   - Import the backend code into your preferred Java IDE.
   - Run the Spring application.
4. Frontend Setup:
   - Serve the frontend files using a web server (e.g., Apache HTTP Server, Nginx).
   - Access the frontend interface via a web browser.

**Usage:**
- Upon accessing the frontend interface, users can perform CRUD operations on user data.
- Interactions with the frontend will trigger corresponding API calls to the backend.
- Backend will handle these requests and process the data accordingly.
